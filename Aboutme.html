			<p>You may have decided to go for therapy and the next decision is who to choose. For me itâ€™s important that
				you know something about me so that your decision is an informed one.</p>
			<p>I have a BA(Hons) in Counselling and Psychotherapy from CIT. My training was both theoretical and
				experiential. I had the opportunity during this time to study various approaches to use in practice,
				which means I am an integrative, humanistic therapist, drawing on different theories depending on the
				needs of the client. As a humanistic therapist, my belief is that you, the client, have all the answers
				in you already. It is my job to give you the space to uncover the strengths and resilience within, which
				can help bring about the desired change. </p>
			<p>During my training, I experienced my own personal growth, faced many lost parts of myself that I learned
				to love again and came to understand a new, freer way to live. Throughout, I attended therapy myself and
				found great support and healing there.</p>
			<p>I have spent time working in the HSE mental health services as a trainee therapist. The work there was
				rich and varied and the learning was immense. I also spent time with Breaking the Silence, Cobh,
				supporting clients impacted by suicide in some way. </p>
			<p>Currently I work with ARC house as a therapist in a voluntary capacity, providing support to those with
				cancer or a family member going through cancer.
				I see clients privately in East Cork and the City centre. I feel privileged to do the work that I do and
				that clients allow me to meet them in the way that they do.
			</p>
			<p>I am currently in the process of building up my client hours to become a fully accredited member of the
				IACP(Irish Association of Counsellors and psychotherapists). As a pre-accredited member, I adhere to
				their high standard of practice and work to their code of ethics. You can read more about that <a
					href="https://iacp.ie/iacp-code-of-ethics" target="_blank">HERE</a>.
